## üìã Description
**Calculadora ENEM** is a web application via which you can calculate the simple and weighted average of your ENEM scores. You can also save your scores, weights of each subject, and results if you create an account. At first, it was designed for my and my sister's personal use, and _it helped us a lot_!  

IIn case you don't know, ENEM (High School National Exam) is Brazil's most important college entrance exam. It lets students from all over the country apply to almost all public universities in Brazil, get scholarships from private universities, and even get a student loan.

You can find more information on [ENEM's official website](https://www.gov.br/inep/pt-br/areas-de-atuacao/avaliacao-e-exames-educacionais/enem).

## üí° Calculadora ENEM's Main Features

Calculadora ENEM **solves a common bother** that students come across during this delicate time of their life, which is having to calculate _over and over again_ their final scores for multiple university courses, and having to either type the same scores _again and again_, or write down manually their scores and results _all the time_. It lets you:

üòÑ Calculate your ENEM simple and weighted avererage. 

ü§ì Save your scores for multiple ENEM's. 

üòé Save different weights for multiple courses. 

üò≤ Use your saved scores, weights and results again on the calculator with a button click! 

The main goal is to help students **optimize** this process and **focus on what really matters** while planning and wondering which course they're going to apply to.


## üìÅ Project Files and Folders

This script **calculates the simple and weighted average** of the scores submitted via the homepage form.
- It **shows the results** on the page for the user;
